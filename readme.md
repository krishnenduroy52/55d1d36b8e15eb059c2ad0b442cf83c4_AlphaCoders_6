# Problem Statement 6

System for Geo-Tagging of privately owned cameras

## Problem Identification:

Private cameras in businesses, homes, and institutions play a crucial role in enhancing public safety and crime detection. Many private cameras lack clear locations, making it difficult for the police to efficiently access relevant video footage during investigations in specific crime-prone areas.

## Solution:

## 1. **Google Map Integration:**
   - **CCTV Image to Location Extraction:** Seamlessly extract location information from CCTV images.
   - **User Registration and License Assignment:** Empower users to register their cameras and assign a unique license to each device.
   - **Google Map Integration:** Visualize the entire network of private cameras on Google Maps.
   - **Visibility Range Detection:** Utilize OpenCV to intelligently detect and map the visibility range of each camera.
## 2. **Smart Crime Detection:**
   - **AI-powered Incident Detection:** Leverage advanced AI technology to identify road accidents, firearm presence, and suspicious activities.
   - **Real-time Alerts:** Receive instant alerts in the control room for swift response to potential threats.
## 3. **CCTV to Control Room Interaction:**
   - **Web RTC Integration:** Establish seamless, real-time communication between private cameras and the control room.
   - **Efficient Monitoring:** Enable control room operators to monitor multiple cameras simultaneously.
## 4. **Emergency Alert System:**
   - **AI-driven Suspicious Event Detection:** Quickly identify and alert the control room to suspicious events.
   - **Swift Notifications:** Instantly notify authorities and users via SMS and mobile applications, including video frames for immediate assessment.
## 5. **Camera Displacement Prevention:**
   - **Image Processing Technology:** Implement sophisticated image processing algorithms to detect any unauthorized camera displacement.
   - **Enhanced Security Measures:** Ensure the integrity of the camera network by preventing tampering or relocation.
